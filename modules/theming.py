### Candlelight
## A TUI frontend to Canvas because the website sucks
# Theming module

"""
Candlelight comes with the Catppuccin theme
by default. It includes 4 different "flavors".
These include Latte, Frappe, Macchiato, and Mocha.

To choose a theme, use the /user/config/theme file. 
This module will automatically find the CSS file 
and tell all the other scripts to use it.

If you're a tinkerer, go to /assets/stylesheets and 
makea new stylesheet. Name it whatever you'd like, 
and write the name of your file in the theme file.
